# Y.A.MAKER

## Project 3 
  For our final project we were required to use the skill set we have developed throughout the course. We have designed a full stack website using ReactJS with a MySQL database. The new technologies we have implemented into our project are paypal and cloudinary. The owner of the website will have a login to maintain the gallery page using a modal.  

# The Handcrafted Heirloom

  "The Handcrafted Heirloom" is a custom made website for a local woodworking business in Arizona. This website will serve as a storefront that allows customers to view and purchase handmade wood crafted goods. Customers are also able to request a personalized commissioned piece. This website will allow for the expansion of the clients customer base beyond his local area, as well as promote his business on a global scale.

### Routes
  The screenshot below shows the routes for the application. The routes that involve a login are for the modal so the owner of the website has easy access to edit the gallery page.

### Cloudinary

### Gallery 
  The screenshot below is from the gallery component. It maps through the items in the database and displays them as images on the page. If the user clicks on a gallery item it will take them to the items page for that image. If the owner is logged in they will see the modal option to edit the images on the gallery page.

### Media Query
  We used media queries for the background images on our pages. As you can see when the page shrinks the image changes. These differences can also be seen between the mobile and desktop view gifs for the same pages.
